Steps to push changes to git repo

	git repo - is the online repo(github, bitbucket, gitlab)
	any other time means local git/ gitBash

	1. make sure you are on the branch you want to push to
	2. git add <files  to add to the commit>
		- putting letters(files) in the envelope
	3. git commit to commit added files
		- sealing the envelop
	4. git push pushes commits to the repo
	**** make sure your branch has the latest code(latest code in development)
		- after(or before pushing) checkout develop locally
		- git pull while on develop
		- git checkout branch you are working on(shortcut: "git checkout -")
		- git merge develop
		- git push(so that current branch is updated in the repo)

	git commands:
		- git branch <name of branch>
			- will create branch, but wont make that branch current branch
		- git checkout <branch name>
			- will move to branch named
		- git checkout -b <branch name>
			- creates a new branch with branch named and moves to new branch
		- git branch -m <branch name>
			- will rename current branch to branch named
		- git branch -d <branch name>
			- will delete branch named
			- "-D" force delete
		- git status
			- will show current state of the branch(files commited or not commited)
