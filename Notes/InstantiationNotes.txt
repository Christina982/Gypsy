	 **** This file has some guidlines and notes on instantiating objects and primitive types in Java


	 How to instantiate an object:
	 	- instantitaite - new <Object Type>();
		- other words for instantiate: new, new an Object, create object
		- *** we do not "new" primitive types

		ie:
			new Object();    		// creates a new Object of type "Object"
			new Tina("name", "age"); 	// creates a new Object of type "Tina"
			new Car(); 			// creates a new Object of type "Car"
			new ArrayList();
			new Person();
	How to declare a variable:
		- creates a variable or placeholer for some data type
			- the data type can be a primitive or an Object
		- we declare by first stating the type, then we give it a name
			- <Object/primitive type> <variable name>

		ie:
			String myString;
			int myInt;
			Tina margieJr;

	Initialization:
		- *** this is different than an instantiation
		- an Initialization is a declaration + an instantiation
		- <Declaration> = <Initialization/primitive>

		ie: 
			Tina margieJunior = new Tina();
			int myInt = 47;
			String myString = "Some string value, *** note: this is not a primitive, it is still an object";
			// the above is an object becuase the complier creates a "new String() when it sees ""
			String otherString = "instantiates a string"

	Other notes:
		- primitive types are always declared with a lower case type(int, char, boolean)
		- primitive types do not need to be "newed"/instantiated\
